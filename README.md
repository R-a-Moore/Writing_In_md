# README.md

This document will tell you how to write .md files for github.

## .md Files
.md files on github allow you to write documentation for projects, providing instructions for yourself later on or others who do not know how to carry out specfiic technical tasks.
If you have not set up github prior to this, please follow the steps to [Setting up a Github](https://github.com/R-a-Moore/GitHub_Setup), as it will be necessary for this tutorial.

The plugins you will need in order to work on .md files in pycharm are;

- Markdown
- Markdown Image Support (optional)
- Markdown Editor (optional)
- Paste Images into Markdown (optional)

Once installed, you should be able to view the 'Install' button as greyed out and be able to view them in your I nstalled folder.

## Writing In .md

Once you've installed these plugins, you will be able to create .md files and write in them in pycharm projects. You can create a README.md file, by right clicking on the project file in pycharm > New > File. Name this whatever you like, for this instance it will be named README.md. You can also a create it in git bash.

You can right in this README.md whatever you choose. Simply typing out and saving the work. If you wish to preview the work you've done, make sure to select the double panel page in the top right.

There are a number of techniques you can use to alter your text in the README.md file:

- `# ` makes headings in your text, the more `## ` you use the lower the level of the heading.
- `- ` creates bullet points
- You can insert links by using `["name"]("link")`
- You can insert images by using `!["name"]("image link")`

So in all, your pycharm README.md should look like this:
